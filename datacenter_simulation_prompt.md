# Global Datacenter Capacity Planning and Geopolitical Risk Simulation: An Integrated Economic Analysis Framework

## Project Overview

This comprehensive simulation project addresses one of the most pressing challenges in global technology infrastructure: the explosive growth in datacenter energy demand (projected to triple by 2028 and consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity) driven by AI workloads, coupled with severe supply chain constraints in semiconductor manufacturing and complex geopolitical tensions affecting global technology supply networks. 

The simulation combines economic modeling, international trade analysis, and infrastructure planning to create a decision-support system for policymakers, infrastructure investors, and multinational technology corporations navigating this complex landscape.

## Core Problem Statement

Global datacenter capital expenditure surged 51% to $455 billion in 2024, with demand expected to grow by another 30% in 2025. Simultaneously, semiconductor supply chains face unprecedented constraints due to geopolitical tensions, infrastructure costs, and concentration risks, with up to 50% of chip sales potentially coming from AI applications by 2025. This creates a complex optimization challenge involving:

1. **Capacity Planning Under Uncertainty**: Balancing massive infrastructure investments against volatile demand and supply chain disruptions
2. **Geopolitical Risk Assessment**: Evaluating how trade restrictions, tariffs, and regional tensions affect optimal infrastructure placement
3. **Energy-Economic Trade-offs**: Optimizing power allocation across competing demands while meeting sustainability targets
4. **Supply Chain Resilience**: Developing robust procurement strategies amid semiconductor shortages and export controls
